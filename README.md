# NoMoreFog
A Northgard mod which removes intrusive fog from multiple weathers (e.g. storm, blizzard). If you're anything like me, and you hate not being able to see anything the moment rain falls, a storm rages, or a blizzard howls, this mod is for you.
- Fog removed on rain, storm, and blizzard events.

## __Disclaimer__
None of the assets used in this mod belong to me. All credit and rights go to the creators of Northgard, Shiro Games. This mod is merely a harmless modification of game files meant to be used in solo and cooperative play.

Special thanks to Manevolent, whose setup, patience, and guidance made this possible.

## __Installation__
Download `res1.pak` and place it within your Northgard folder. For Steam, this would look something like this: `X\Steam\steamapps\common\Northgard`

You can easily reach it by right-clicking the game in your Steam Library and pressing `Manage -> Browse local files`. You should now have `res.pak` and `res1.pak`.

NOTE: If you already have a `res1.pak`, you will need to rename this one to `res2.pak`. The game reads `res.pak` files in numerical order, starting from `res.pak` -> `res1.pak` -> `res2.pak`, etc. If you have `res.pak` and `res2.pak`, the game will NOT load `res2.pak`.

### **Will this mod work in co-op?**
Yes. You can play co-op with your friends, but you must launch the game in Peer-to-Peer, and they must also have this mod installed. If you play on servers, the mod will not be loaded.

### **Will this mod affect multiplayer?**
This mod DOES affect multiplayer, and using it in multiplayer is a BANNABLE OFFENSE. I take NO responsibility for any consequences of actions you take with this mod against other players. This mod is made specifically for consentual use between players and for cooperative play and has NO place in multiplayer (especially ranked).

## __Uninstallation__
Simply delete `res1.pak` (or whatever you named this pak to) from the folder.
